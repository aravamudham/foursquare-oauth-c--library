A C# implementation of foursquare oauth to connect to the API

To use this code, you will need a client id/key which you can set up by going to developer.foursquare.com and registering 
your application. You also need to include the pre-build dll - foursquarenewapi.dll which is included in this project.

The code is self-explanatory but in case you are stuck or need help, pls email me at: praveen.aravamudham@gmail.com

Thanks!!!
